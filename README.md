# My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles.

To use them somewhere else, clone this repo (into, say, `~/dotfiles`), then
symlink to the dotfile(s) you want.

I stole some of this from other places, and while I've mostly tried to provide
attribution, there may be places I've missed. The rest of this is likely to be
mostly uncopyrightable; if I have made any significant contributions, consider
them MIT licensed, because MIT is bae.

Test lol.

## To do
