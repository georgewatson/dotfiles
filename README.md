# My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

To use them somewhere else, clone this repo (into, say, `~/dotfiles`), then symlink to the dotfile(s) you want.

I stole most of this from other places and, because I'm very naughty, I "forgot" to credit the people I stole it from.

**Disclaimer:** There's a good chance none of this will work on another system because of unmet dependencies; a lot of it is also likely to be completely useless if you don't have my specific needs - in particular, I use these dotfiles for scientific computing that's way outside most people's workflow.

## To do
- [ ] Give credit to people I stole stuff from (and make clear which bits are my own)
- [ ] Resolve (or document) dependencies
- [ ] Add more dotfiles
- [ ] Organise and comment things better

## Licence
Most of this belongs to other people. The rest is probably simple enough to be uncopyrightable. If any of my original contributions are significant and useful to someone else, feel free to do what you want with them (but I'd appreciate some credit, despite having denied that to everyone I stole sections of these dotfiles from). Consider my bits (which hopefully I'll clearly identify at some point) MIT-licensed, I guess, but I'm not gonna sic a lawyer on you.
